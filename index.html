          <h3>About me:</h3>
        </p>
          <p>
          I am a 16 year old proud Mexican and rising senior who still has no idea what she wants to do with her future but I do know I just want happiness with wherever life leads me. I am a part of Girls Who Code in Chicago and a designer for my schoolâ€™s newspaper. I am also a DP student from the IB Program, ranked 2nd in my class, aspiring for 1st and a lot of success! I love chocolate, it might be an unhealthy obsession but chocolate is the way to my heart! I'm also such a picky eater, others love ketchup, I hate it, others love soda, I hate it, sooo many things people love, I don't.
          </p>
      </div>

      <h3><strong>Fun Facts:</strong></h3>

        <p>/ Although I'm Mexican, I have never actually been to Mexico </p>
        <p>/ I'm a really picky eater, there's a lot of foods I haven't tried because of that. There's also a lot I have tried and don't like, despite it being very common (ex. ketchup, barbecue, soda)</p>
        <p>/ I love to draw digitally, I'm self taught and enjoy drawing realistic portraits</p>
        <p>/ I have a cute dog but we don't know what breed she is or how old she is </p> -->

      <h3>My Art:</h3>
      <div>
        I used to draw people as literal potatos and now I draw realism!
      </div>
      <div>
        And by literal potatos, I'm serious! Stick figures were for lame kids, I drew a whole oval with a smiley face and stick arms and legs. People always ask me how I'm able to draw what I draw and honestly it's all because of practice. If you want to be good at something you <em>have</em> to practice! I've been practicing drawing since middle school and I used to be terrible. I have experience in drawing traditionally (paper and pencil) but I discovered digital drawing and bought myself a drawing tablet when I was around 15-16 and fell in love with digital art. It was really hard at first but after a lot of <em>practice</em> I was able to learn how to use my drawing tablet and learn how to use Photoshop, which is the program I use to draw on.

      <h3>Meet My Dog!</h3>
      <p>
        Like I've mentioned before, I have a dog named Princess! I've had her for a little over a month and she's the cutest lil bub that uses me for belly rubs. She loves going outside and she loves squeaky toys.
