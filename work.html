    <h1>My Work</h1>
    <p><u>Art</u></p>
    <p>
      I used to draw people as literal potatos and now I draw realism!
    </p>
    <p>
      And by literal potatos, I'm serious! Stick figures were for lame kids, I drew a whole oval with a smiley face and stick arms and legs. People always ask me how I'm able to draw what I draw and honestly it's all because of practice. If you want to be good at something you <em>have</em> to practice! I've been practicing drawing since middle school and I used to be terrible. I have experience in drawing traditionally (paper and pencil) but I discovered digital drawing and bought myself a drawing tablet when I was around 15-16 and fell in love with digital art. It was really hard at first but after a lot of <em>practice</em> I was able to learn how to use my drawing tablet and learn how to use Photoshop, which is the program I use to draw on.

      Art theft is real! I've been through it which is why I always sign my art.
    </p>
    <p>
    I love drawing so much here's more art I made for school art projects:
  </p>
    <img src = "ArtSketch.jpg"
    alt="digital artwork"
    width="400"

    <p><u>Community Service</u><p>
      <p> I volunteer at an organization called "Working Bikes" which is dedicated to collecting donated bikes, fixing them up, and shipping them to countries in need in order to make transportation a bit easier for those that are not able to afford transportation. I am also a part of my schools National Honors Society which also participates in different service projects.</p>
    <p><u>Computers</u></p>
        <p> I am currently involved in Girls Who Code which focuses on teaching girls the basics of computer science. Throughout this, I'm able to acquire new knowledge on different coding languages such as Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I also have experience on Adobe Photoshop and InDesign.</p>
