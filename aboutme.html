    <h1>About Me</1>
    </P>
      <p>
      I am a 16 year old proud Mexican and rising senior who still has no idea what she wants to do with her future but I do know I just want happiness with wherever life leads me. I am a part of Girls Who Code in Chicago and a designer for my schoolâ€™s newspaper. I love chocolate, it might be an unhealthy obsession but chocolate is the way to my heart! I'm also such a picky eater, others love ketchup, I hate it, others love soda, I hate it, sooo many things people love, I don't.
      </p>
      <p>I currently attend Back of the Yards College Preparatory High School. I am also a DP student taking DP classes which are similar to AP classes but more rigorous from the IB Program. I'm ranked 2nd in my class, aspiring for 1st and a lot of success! </p>
      <p><u>Fun Facts:</u><p>
        <p>/ Although I'm Mexican, I have never actually been to Mexico </p>
        <p>/ I'm a really picky eater, there's a lot of foods I haven't tried because of that. There's also a lot I have tried and don't like, despite it being very common (ex. ketchup, barbecue, soda)</p>
        <p>/ I love to draw digitally, I'm self taught and enjoy drawing realistic portraits</p>
        <p>/ I have a cute dog but we don't know what breed she is or how old she is </p>

        <p><u>Meet My Dog!</u></p>
        <p>
          Like I've mentioned before, I have a dog named Princess! I've had her for a little over a month and she's the cutest lil bub that uses me for belly rubs. She loves going outside, squeaky toys, belly rubs, eating, sleeping, and sniffing stuff.
